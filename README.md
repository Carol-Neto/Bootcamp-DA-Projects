# Sprint 1 - Basic Python

During the first two weeks of the bootcamp, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the world of data science. Intensive practice in exploratory data analysis allowed me to deepen my understanding of string manipulation, loop construction, and list operations. Through this journey, I understood how data analysis can reveal valuable insights, transforming raw data into relevant and actionable information. The ability to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies in data is essential for making more assertive decisions and driving the resolution of complex problems.
